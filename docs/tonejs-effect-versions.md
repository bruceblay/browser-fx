# Tone.js Effect Versions - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the differences between our custom Web Audio API effects and Tone.js implementations, and provides a roadmap for implementing Tone.js versions alongside our custom ones for A/B comparison.

## Effect Comparison Analysis

### BitCrusher

**Our Implementation (`offscreen-effects.js:122-156`)**
- Uses `ScriptProcessorNode` with custom `onaudioprocess` callback
- Manual bit-depth reduction: `Math.round(lastSample * step) / step`
- **Unique feature:** Sample rate reduction via counter logic
- Real-time parameter updates via shared `liveParams`
- Parameters: `bits` (1-16), `normalRange` (sample rate reduction), `wet` (0-1)

**Tone.js Implementation**
- Uses modern `AudioWorkletNode` for better performance and stability
- Professional-grade bit-depth quantization algorithm
- Range: 1-16 bits (no sample rate reduction component)
- Built-in wet/dry mixing and effect chaining

**Sound Difference:** Our version combines bit-crushing with sample rate reduction creating a more aggressive, "vintage" digital distortion. Tone.js focuses purely on bit-depth reduction with cleaner processing.

### Chorus

**Our Implementation (`offscreen-effects.js:284-362`)**
- Two delay lines with independent LFO modulation
- Simple sine wave LFOs at different frequencies (rate * 1.0 and rate * 1.3)
- Delay time in milliseconds (2-20ms range)
- Manual stereo processing with basic wet/dry mix

**Tone.js Implementation**
- More sophisticated stereo processing with spread parameter
- Built-in transport synchronization
- Multiple LFO waveform options (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth)
- Professional parameter scaling designed by audio engineers

**Sound Difference:** Similar core effect, but Tone.js has better stereo imaging, smoother modulation, and more musical parameter ranges.

### Distortion

**Our Implementation (`offscreen-effects.js:209-282`)**
- Uses `WaveShaper` with custom distortion curve generation
- Dynamic curve based on drive amount (1-51x drive)
- Three distortion modes based on amount: soft clipping, harder clipping, hard limiting
- Tone filter (2kHz-10kHz lowpass)

**Tone.js Implementation**
- Uses `WaveShaper` with professional distortion algorithm
- Oversampling options ("none", "2x", "4x")
- Single distortion curve optimized for musical applications
- Built-in anti-aliasing

**Sound Difference:** Our version has more aggressive, varied distortion modes. Tone.js focuses on cleaner, more predictable musical distortion.

### Reverb

**Our Implementation (`offscreen-effects.js:158-207`)**
- Simple convolution with generated noise impulse response
- Basic early reflection simulation
- Parameters: `roomSize`, `decay`, `wet`

**Tone.js Implementation**
- Professional impulse response generation
- Pre-delay parameter for realistic room simulation
- More sophisticated early reflection modeling
- Better tail characteristics

**Sound Difference:** Our version is simpler and more "lo-fi". Tone.js sounds more realistic and professional.

   - Update effect switching logic

9. **Update Message Handling**

## Technical Considerations

### Tone.js Integration Challenges

1. **AudioContext Sharing**
   - Tone.js expects to manage its own AudioContext
   - Need to configure Tone.js to use our existing context
   - May need to call `Tone.setContext(audioContext)` early

2. **Effect Lifecycle Management**
   - Tone.js effects have `.dispose()` methods for cleanup
   - Need to properly dispose of effects when switching
   - Handle Tone.js effect start/stop lifecycle

3. **Parameter Mapping**
   - Tone.js uses different parameter names/ranges
   - Need translation layer between our UI and Tone.js effects
   - Some parameters may not have direct equivalents

4. **Chrome Extension Security**
   - AudioWorklet requires HTTPS in production
   - May need fallbacks for development environment
   - Ensure CSP compatibility with Tone.js

### Expected Benefits

1. **Professional Sound Quality**
   - More polished, musical-sounding effects
   - Better anti-aliasing and artifact reduction
   - Professional parameter scaling

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - AudioWorklet-based processing (where supported)
   - Better CPU utilization
   - Reduced audio thread blocking

3. **Feature Completeness**
   - Access to Tone.js ecosystem features
   - Professional effect algorithms
   - Better real-time parameter control

### Success Metrics

- [ ] All four Tone.js effects implemented and functional
- [ ] A/B switching works seamlessly without audio dropouts
- [ ] Performance equals or exceeds custom implementations
- [ ] User can clearly hear differences between versions
- [ ] No regressions in existing custom effects functionality
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Next Steps

1. Start with BitCrusher as the proof of concept
2. Verify Tone.js integration works in offscreen document
3. Implement basic A/B switching UI
4. Gradually add remaining effects
5. Conduct thorough testing and optimization

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to implementing Tone.js versions alongside our custom effects, enabling direct A/B comparison and giving users the choice between different sonic characteristics.
